Motivation
----------

Viscoelastic models describe materials that exhibit both elastic and time-dependent (viscous) behavior, such as polymers, biological tissues, and rubbers under long-term loading. These models capture phenomena like stress relaxation, creep, and hysteresis.

Kinematics & Constitutive Laws
------------------------------

Viscoelasticity is often modeled using combinations of springs (elastic elements) and dashpots (viscous elements), leading to classic models such as Maxwell, Kelvinâ€“Voigt, and Standard Linear Solid. The constitutive equations relate stress, strain, and their time derivatives.

Example: Generalized Maxwell Model
----------------------------------

The stress evolution is governed by:

.. math::
   \sigma(t) + \sum_{i=1}^N \tau_i \frac{d\sigma}{dt} = \sum_{i=0}^N E_i \left( \varepsilon(t) + \tau_i \frac{d\varepsilon}{dt} \right)

where :math:`E_i` are elastic moduli and :math:`\tau_i` are relaxation times.

Time-Domain Response
--------------------

* **Creep:** Strain response to a constant applied stress.
* **Stress relaxation:** Stress response to a constant applied strain.
* **Hysteresis:** Energy dissipation under cyclic loading.

Frequency-Domain Response
-------------------------

* **Storage modulus** and **loss modulus** describe the elastic and viscous response under oscillatory loading.
