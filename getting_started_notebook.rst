Motivations
Why lib-ela? Programming now sits at the heart of modern science and engineering — and Python’s open ecosystem makes it the natural hub for solid mechanics research, education, and tooling.

Overview
Programming has become an integral part of modern science and engineering, with the rapidly evolving fields of artificial intelligence (AI) and data science increasingly woven into their fabric. Among the many programming languages, Python stands out for its versatility and its growing ecosystem of open-source tools for scientific computing, AI, and data analysis.

In the field of solid mechanics, the development of constitutive models, from early hyperelastic and viscoelastic formulations to more recent multiphysics models, has been ongoing for decades. While some of these models have been implemented in commercial software like ABAQUS, ANSYS, or COMSOL, such implementations are typically limited to only finite element analysis (FEA). These platforms often restrict model usage to within their own environments, making it difficult to connect them with the broader ecosystem of open-source tools in Python.

To bridge this gap, we are currently developing libela (short for library of elasticity), a free and open-source Python library for the solid mechanics community. The goal of libela is to provide symbolic access to a wide range of hyperelastic, viscoelastic, and multiphysics constitutive models, making them fully accessible, extendable, and interoperable with other Python-based tools.

The idea for libela first took shape during my visit to the University of Calgary in the summer of 2024. Since then, I have assembled a team of talented engineers and software developers, and we are continuously working on advancing and refining this platform
